# OpenHouseWalkThru

Open House Walk Thru is a web app designed for potential homebuyers who can use it to enhance their open house experiences while searching for a home. It allows the user to document different features of a home that they would like to evaluate. This includes rating features (such as garage, kitchen, etc.) based on a 1-5 point scale, uploading photos and writing comments about it. A large focus of the app is that it enables users to visualize the locations of their houses on a map relative to points of interest that they may frequent to, such as a local church, school, work or anything else. The app scores and ranks the houses accordingly based on the userâ€™s ratings.

## Technologies Used

OpenHouseWalkThru is built using React+Redux, and uses Firebase for data storage. For image storage, Cloudinary is used and connected to Firebase. Google Maps is used to visualize map information of the houses and points of interests.
